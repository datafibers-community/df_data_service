# DataFibers Data Services
DataFibers (DF) - A pure streaming processing application on Kafka and Flink. 
The DF processor has two components defined to deal with stream ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load).
* **Connects** is to leverage Kafka Connect REST API on Confluent to landing or publishing data in or out of Apache Kafka.
* **Transforms** is to leverage streaming processing engine, such as Apache Flink, for data transformation.

## Building

You build the project using:

```
mvn clean package
```

## Testing

The application is tested using [vertx-unit](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-unit/java/).

## Packaging

The application is packaged as a _fat jar_, using the 
[Maven Shade Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/).

## Running

Once packaged, just launch the _fat jar_ as follows ways

* Default with no parameters to launch standalone mode with web ui.
```
java -jar df-data-service-<version>-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
```

* For more running features checking help option
```
